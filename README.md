#### Workflow for the LLR Analysis including our new `Nt=5` datasets

This is for now a work-in-progress. 
This code assumes that julia is installed. 
No LaTeX is required.

As of now julia-1.10.4 from conda does not work with this code. But we probably don't need it since there are no dependencies outside of julia (except for 'zstd' but we can change that) and we can skip using conda altogether. 

The raw data and metadata can be downloaded from OneDrive (I suggest using the following wget command since its 11GB)
```
wget -c "https://swanseauniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/fabian_zierler_swansea_ac_uk/EaEMEKGYGDRDicdLeeoMnuMBUd1RW2Q6iquuoTZI3M7V4A?e=NuLivj&download=1"
```

Unzip the archive, and decompress the `tar.zst` files in `raw_data`. After decompression the raw data takes up ~120GB of space. 
Place `metadata` and `raw_data` into the repo's top level directory.

The parsing can be done by executing `bash main_parsing.sh`.
The plots and tables are generated by executing `bash main_analysis.sh`.
