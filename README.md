#### Workflow for the LLR Analysis including our new `Nt=5` datasets

This is for now a work-in-progress. 
This code assumes that julia is installed. 
I have yet to test this agains julia-1.10.4 from conda. 
No LaTeX is required.

The parsing can be done by executing `bash main_parsing.sh`.
The plots and tables are generated by executing `bash main_analysis.sh`.

The location of the raw log files needs to be provided in metadata. 
I will start bundling the existing data soon, so that we also have a draft for the data release.
